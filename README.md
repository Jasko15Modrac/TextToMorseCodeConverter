# TextToMorseCodeConverter
A program that converts text to morse code text, to morse code audio signals and morse code light signals

For program to fully function you need to download three files for audio playback since I couldn't push them to GitHub due to their size over 100 MB.

To access the large files used in this project, please download them from the following links:

- [ffmpeg.exe](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-pzaB0ZiPzD4K2MX3o21Ib3E1Jia81mV/view?usp=sharing) Size: 127.1 MB
- [ffplay.exe](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-tk-OQ9W3JDewLED29c9g1fhAoccNrzd/view?usp=sharing) Size: 126.9 MB
- [ffprobe.exe](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-lckC7spX2VfYWbZyZll8hVw4HT65DoL/view?usp=sharing) Size: 126.9

More about functioning of the program you can find in documentation file.
